
FRONTEND STAGE THREE TASK
Task Description
In this stage, you'll take your static Timbu Cloud shop page from Stage 2 and breathe life into it using Timbu APIs!
API Exploration: Familiarize yourself with the Timbu API documentation to understand the functionalities available.
Integration Strategy: Plan how you'll integrate the Timbu APIs to achieve a fully functional shop page. This might involve product catalog management, and potentially a simulated checkout flow.
API Implementation: Integrate the Timbu APIs into your existing work to achieve the desired functionalities.
Requirements
Technologies: React, Next + any relevant technology.
Timbu APIs: Utilize relevant Timbu APIs to achieve functionalities like product management and a simulated checkout flow.
Create a Timbu account on timbu.cloud . Get your API key (it only views once).
Add at least 30 products to your timbu account under Retail Business.
Retrieve all product information using the api.
The display of at least 10 products with images from the timbu api on a page with proper pagination
Functionality: The shop page should maintain its visual design from Stage 2.
Users should be able to interact with the page (e.g., view products, and simulate checkout flow).
The following should work exceptionally
Add to Cart
Increase and decrease quantity but quantity should not be less than 1(else it should not be in the cart).
Increasing or decreasing quantity should also reflect on the price.
Remove from Cart
Clear Cart
Show relevant information about the products you have added on timbu in the list item.
Proper UI state management and handling errors properly.
Timbu APIs should be integrated to manage product data, and potentially simulate checkout processes.
Acceptance Criteria:
API Integration: Successful integration of relevant Timbu APIs product management, and simulated checkout flow.
Functionality:The shop page is fully functional with user interaction capabilities.
Sleek UI Implementation of the designer's work.
Implementation of Timbu API .
Users can navigate through the shop page and view product details.
Each Product should be clickable and should navigate to a product page or product modal as per your design (Use the product_id from the API to achieve this)
Add Multiple images to the product in your timbu account to implement a product Gallery on the product page or product modal.
A simulated checkout process demonstrates the flow (without real payment processing).
Build React components to manage different functionalities of the shop page (products, cart, checkout).
Code Quality: Well-structured, documented, and maintainable code that effectively interacts with Timbu APIs.
Submission Mode:
Submit your task through the designated submission form. Ensure you've:
Hosted the page on a platform of your choice (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
Double-checked all requirements and acceptance criteria.
Provided the hosted page's URL in the submission form.
Provided a link to the Figma file of the design.
Thoroughly review your work to ensure accuracy, functionality, and adherence to the specified guidelines before you submit it.
Submission Deadline:
The deadline for submissions is Saturday, at <11:59 PM GMT>. Late submissions will not be entertained. @channel
